1. Add a config.ini file with contents like so:

[pyrogram]
api_id = %your api id%
api_hash = %your api hash%

2. run requirements install:

pip install -r requirements

3. start script:

python main.py

---

Script will ask for your phone number, and then the authorization code.
After auth is succeeded it will ask which chats/channels you want to track
and what chat/channel should receive all the reposts

Pyrogram hotfix

You need to open this file <pyrogram_root>/pyrogram/api/types/messages/channel_messages.py and put this line Int.read(b) right after the # No flags comment in read method, line 44
